## Description
Semio is a objective semiology diagnostic tool, intended for usage as a conflict mediator among 
surgeons during discussions concerning seizure-onset-zone. Semio has a sizeable database of semiology 
information pulled from current and past literature. The database can be appended at any time to 
reflect new developments in the field. The user selects all symptoms exhibited by a patient, choosing 
also the symptom's side of onset. These selected symptoms are then used to calculate the probability of 
seizure onset for different locations cross the brain. Once the user has selected the patient's 
symptoms and chosen to render the probabilities, a 3D representation of the brain can be quickly 
rendered with the probabilities overlayed.

## First Run
Unzip Semio.zip somewhere easily accessible on your computer. To run the application, double click on 
the file titled "Semio.exe". Choose your symptoms and when ready, go to File > Export and Render. This
will launch the 3D rendering application, which will prompt you to select the mesh directory. Browse to 
the directory containing Semio.exe and select the directory named "mesh". Press continue, and the brain
will be rendered with your selected symptoms overlayed.
